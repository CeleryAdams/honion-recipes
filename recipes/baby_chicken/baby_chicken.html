        <p>
            So this is a very cute and delicious snack. Maybe it is too tiny
            and furry to eat. But if you wait a few months you can eat it.
            Trust me. It's very tasty. You can boil or fry the baby chicken.
            You can even make a salad. Wait until it is no longer as cute
            as this. When the tastiness is more than the cuteness, you can eat
            this baby chicken without any regret. You will know when the time
            comes. Also you need to be hungry.
